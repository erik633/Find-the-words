# Find-the-words
Uni-task

A “word search” puzzle is a word game that consists of the letters of
words placed in a grid. The objective of this puzzle is to find and
mark all the words hidden inside the box. The words may be placed
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Programming task:

Write a Python program that can look for words in a given grid. For
test purposes, a 15x15 grid where at least 15 words are “hidden” is
given. The hidden words can be found by scanning the matrix in the
following directions:
↓ top to bottom ↑ bottom to top
↘ diagonal top to bottom
↗ diagonal bottom to top
